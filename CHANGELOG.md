- Interactive design mockup (`design/mockup.html`).
- P1 ingress server foundation: `/healthz`, static file serving, SSR placeholder, graceful
  shutdown.
- `/bin` gitignored build-output directory.
- gRPC contract (`ContentService`, `ContactService`) with generated stubs via `buf` (pure Go).
- `ContentService` implementation: featured-project dataset + about copy, unit-tested.
